# Human Shield
 
This was supposed to be my second game that I made by myself with no tutorials. I didn't really work out and I don't like the game. Its just not fun. I think its mostly complete, but I still don't want to count it as my second solo game.

In the game there is an NPC named Lily that just wanders around a field, and the player named Jimmy has to protect her since there are meteors flying all over the place. Luckily Jimmy can destroy the meteors by touching them. If Lily gets hit three times(?) she dies and you lose.

I could be wrong but I think the idea for this came from a Ludum Dare Game Jam theme. I'm pretty sure it was "Keep it Alive."
